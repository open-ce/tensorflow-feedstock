Subject: [PATCH] Remove extra null terminators

TF_CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH will be stored as an
absolute path during the bazel build. Conda uses build paths that are
256 characters long. During conda install, it will replace the build path
with the shorter install path and append null terminators to keep the
binary file the same size. We need to use c_str() to remove the extra
null terminators.
